The other (climatology) predicts whatever the average historical weather has been on this day from prior years.\"_ What is the mean absolute error for each baseline? What if you average the two together? \n",

Add more [preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) and [imputation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html) to your [pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html) with scikit-learn.\n",
