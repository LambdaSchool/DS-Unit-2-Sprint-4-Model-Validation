    "- Replicate the lesson code. [Do it \"the hard way\" or with the \"Benjamin Franklin method.\"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubOw9B3Hfip27hF2ZFnW3a3z9xAgrUDRReOEo-FHCVs/edit)\n",
    "- Apply the lesson to other datasets you've worked with before, and compare results.\n",
    "- Choose how to split the Bank Marketing dataset. Train and validate baseline models.\n",
    "- Get weather data for your own area and calculate both baselines.  _\"One (persistence) predicts that the weather tomorrow is going to be whatever it was today. The other (climatology) predicts whatever the average historical weather has been on this day from prior years.\"_ What is the mean absolute error for each baseline? What if you average the two together? \n",
    "- When would this notebook's pipelines fail? How could you fix them? Add more [preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) and [imputation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html) to your [pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html) with scikit-learn.\n",
    "- [This example from scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/compose/plot_column_transformer_mixed_types.html) demonstrates its improved `OneHotEncoder` and new `ColumnTransformer` objects, which can replace functionality from third-party libraries like category_encoders and sklearn-pandas. Adapt this example, which uses Titanic data, to work with another dataset.\n"
